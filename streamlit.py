        ## Important Instructions for the Drawing Analysis  
        - **Stay Calm & Focused** ‚Äì Ensure the child is in a normal, undisturbed mood before drawing, as this is a serious psychological assessment.  
        - **Create a 2D Drawing** ‚Äì The person should be a simple two-dimensional sketch, not a 3D perspective.  
        - **Include Key Features** ‚Äì The drawing can include facial features, hands, feet, clothing, or any other details.  
        - **Shading is Allowed** ‚Äì Any part of the drawing can be shaded if desired.
