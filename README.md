🧠 PsyReport: AI-Powered Psychological Insights from Children's Drawings
“Sometimes, a child's drawing speaks louder than words.”

🌟 Introduction
Children's drawings are more than just art—they're windows into their emotions, thoughts, and subconscious mind.

Globally, around 8% of children and 15% of adolescents (ages 3–14) experience mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues.
